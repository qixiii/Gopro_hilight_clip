# Runtime Python dependencies for GoPro Highlight Extractor
# -----------------------------------------------
# NOTE: This project currently relies only on the Python standard library
# for its core functionality (file handling, subprocess calls to ffmpeg, GUI
# using tkinter). Therefore there are NO mandatory Python packages to install
# via pip for the main runtime.
#
# System (OS) dependencies required at runtime:
#   - ffmpeg and ffprobe  (install via your package manager, e.g. `sudo apt install ffmpeg`)
#
# Optional runtime packages (uncomment and install if you want these features):
# requests==2.31.0      # HTTP client library (not used by current code)
# tqdm==4.65.0          # Nice CLI progress bars (optional)
#
# Optional packaging helper (dev/use when building standalone binary):
# pyinstaller==5.13.0   # Create standalone executables
#
# To install optional packages, remove the leading '#' and run:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# End of file
